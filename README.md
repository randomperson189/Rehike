A PHP project that aims to faithfully restore the old YouTube layout, known as Hitchhiker.

## Contributors

See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Installation

***Rehike is early in development. You should not expect a perfect user experience, should you choose to use it.***

At the moment, Rehike must be manually installed. In the future, a simplified installer application will be released to streamline installation. As it stands, you will require some knowledge to get through its installation.

Our main development operating system is Windows. As such, these instructions may differ if you are attempting to install Rehike on another operating system.

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4+
   - We recommend using [XAMPP 8+](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- A proxy (to map it to `www.youtube.com`)
   - See [YukisCoffee/hitchhiker's instructions](https://github.com/YukisCoffee/hitchhiker#installation) on this.
   - A proxy is required for video playback, unless you have a CORS bypass extension installed on your browser.

## Acknowledgements

Rehike makes use of the following open source software:

- Composer
- Twig
- paquettg/php-html-parser
- [Return YouTube Dislike API](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/)

and much of their prerequisites.
